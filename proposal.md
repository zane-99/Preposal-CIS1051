# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Endless Possibilties.


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
We are going to create an adventure game that prompts users to make decisions. Decisions form the basis of survival or death as each decsion made gives/takes points. A memory game as a second part of one of the games. Games could vary depending on which one of us is making that sepcific one.



## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
We will be using Renpy to add visual aspects to our project. It will enable us to add sound effects, animations. etc and help us make our project visually appealing. We will be extensively using for loops, dictionaries and random features as well. This will help us to generate random possibilities from a list of options that we feed into our program.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
NA


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Conrad French(tuo18767@temple.edu). TA- Steven Dang. Khushi Patel(tuo75308@temple.edu). TA-Zhenyu Zhao.


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Three different stories. Each story has atleast 3 stages.  Each stage has a list of different possibilities at each sub-step. Points system for each step. Limited animation that makes project visually appealing, but not too advanced. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
In addition to above, random possibilities of hinderance or progress that character faces without doing anything. More stages in story line. Better animation. End of game screen and feedback.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
In addition to the above, sound effects, high quality animation, character preference by user. More stages with more possibilities. Saving high-score and hall of fame.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will learn how to better use and apply python for problem solving. I will also learn how to use Renpy and its different aspects. Each working on individual story lines and character development. Researching Renpy individually and collaborating on learning to assist each other build a better programme.
